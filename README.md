Global Life Expectancy Analysis — Project Description
Problem Statement
Many countries invest heavily in healthcare but still experience low life expectancy. This project aims to identify key factors influencing life expectancy worldwide — such as GDP, immunization rates, education, and healthcare spending — and highlight countries performing above or below expectations.
The goal is to help policymakers and organizations make data-driven health investment decisions. view website in https://life-insight-explorer.lovable.app/

Tools & Methods
python
Microsoft Excel – data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and preliminary correlation analysis.
SQL – used to store, query, and join multiple datasets (WHO, World Bank indicators).
Data Source: WHO Life Expectancy Dataset (Kaggle)
Insights & Solutions
Insights & Solutions
•	Key Insights:
o	Higher GDP, immunization coverage, and education levels strongly correlate with longer life expectancy.
o	Beyond a certain GDP level, returns on life expectancy plateau.
o	Some middle-income countries outperform wealthier ones due to effective public health programs.
•	Solutions Offered:
o	Tableau dashboard for exploring health indicators and predicting life expectancy.
o	“Above/below expectation” country ranking to guide global health priorities.
o	Interactive dashboard to visualize drivers of life expectancy.
o	“What-if” simulator to estimate expected gains from policy changes.
o	Country benchmarking to guide funding and interventions.

Impact
•	For Governments: Optimize health budgets by focusing on high-impact factors.
•	For NGOs/Donors: Identify countries where small investments yield large gains.
•	For Researchers: Provide a data-driven baseline for further policy evaluation.
These insights can lead to better decisions, cost savings, and improved public health outcomes.
Aha! moments (examples you might highlight)
•	A cluster of middle-income countries achieves life expectancy similar to richer countries because of strong immunization coverage and primary care access — showing high ROI for public health programs.
•	Some high-spending countries still underperform, indicating inefficiencies or uneven access (not just money matters).
•	Marginal returns on additional healthcare spending are larger in countries with below-average vaccination coverage — implying that combined investments yield bigger gains.

Deployment Plan
Use loveable or firebase
Dataset Kaggle

Perfect — you already have a solid capstone outline, and it’s great that you want to make it more insightful and unique (not the same basic “GDP vs Life Expectancy” everyone does).
Let’s upgrade your project by adding more objectives and cool “Aha!” moments — while still keeping it realistic for SQL, Excel, or Tableau-level analysis (no heavy Python coding).

🌍 Global Life Expectancy Analysis — Enhanced Project Description
🧩 Problem Statement
Many countries pour billions into healthcare but still record low life expectancy. This project explores what truly drives longevity worldwide, beyond just wealth — examining education, sanitation, pollution, gender gaps, and healthcare access.
It aims to identify which factors matter most, and why some nations outperform others despite limited resources, helping policymakers and NGOs invest smarter, not just more.
________________________________________
🧠 Objectives
1.	Identify the top predictors of life expectancy across countries.
2.	Compare performance between income groups (low, middle, high).
3.	Detect regional outliers — countries performing better or worse than expected.
4.	Examine how environmental factors (like pollution and CO₂ emissions) affect health outcomes.
5.	Create a Tableau dashboard for exploring trends and simulating policy “what-if” changes.

🧰 Tools & Methods
•	Microsoft Excel – for data cleaning, pivot tables, and initial exploration.
•	SQL – for dataset integration, filtering, and correlation queries.
•	Tableau – for interactive dashboards, regional maps, and trend visualizations.
•	Dataset: WHO Life Expectancy Dataset (Kaggle), supplemented with World Bank and UN data (GDP, education, CO₂, health expenditure).

💡 Insights & “Aha!” Moments
•	🌱 Education beats money: Countries with strong education systems often show higher life expectancy than wealthier peers — proving knowledge drives better health habits.
•	💸 Diminishing returns on wealth: Beyond ~$40,000 GDP per capita, added spending has little effect — efficiency > expenditure.
•	🫁 Pollution penalty: Nations with similar healthcare spending but higher CO₂ emissions have up to 7 years lower life expectancy.
•	🧬 Gender gap surprise: In some regions, women’s life expectancy advantage is shrinking — linked to rising lifestyle diseases.
•	🌍 Cluster discovery: Using scatter plots, clusters of high-performing African and Asian countries emerge — showing success through vaccination and sanitation programs, not just money.

🌐 Impact
•	Governments: Improve efficiency of health spending by focusing on key drivers (education, prevention, pollution control).
•	NGOs & Donors: Identify high-ROI interventions for targeted aid.
•	Communities: Advocate for better resource allocation using clear, data-driven evidence.
Result: Better policies, longer lives, and smarter global health investments.
